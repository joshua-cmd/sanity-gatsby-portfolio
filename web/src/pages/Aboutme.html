    <p class="Bio">My name is Kym Cooper. I love the very essence of being an artist! I have loved the scent of
      paint and clay between my fingers since I was in elementary school. I consider myself a multi-
      media surrealist cubist painter who holds a B.F.A. from American University, a law degree from
      Howard University—both schools located in Washington DC and a Master’s in Elementary
      Education from Lesley College, Cambridge, Massachusetts. I create scenarios that touch my
      spirit on canvas. I draw my inspiration from being an Afro-American woman and all in my
      environment that affects my cultural identity and womanhood. I love being. In Art, you can
      express all that you are. You get to choose your medium; your substance and your train of
      thought directs your spirit. It is the most innovative, challenging experience I can think of. It is
      my passion. I hope others can feel my passion and delight in creating. It is a gift and I want to
      spend the rest of my life using my artwork to express it! This exhibit, “The Cubist Surrealism of
      Kym Cooper from an Afro-American Woman Point of View,” is about celebrating our heritage
      and the beauty and essence of being a Black person who happens to be female. It is about the
      tribulations and pitfalls of being Black in America. It is about being visually heard by focusing
      on how spiritually our ancestors talk to us about how to bring the past, present and future
      together in a challenging mosaic. It is the story of us.</p>
